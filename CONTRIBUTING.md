# Contributing
There are a few guidelines for contributing.

## New article
If you'd like to make a new article, make sure that it meets all requirements before publishing:
- All links to article must work
- Article is properly cited and credited
  - This means that whoever wrote the work is listed as the author, and whatever information that was cited inside the article itself is also mentioned and given due credit.
- The article is up to quality standards.
  - Check how other articles look and are written to see if yours is as clean (in design) or as accurate (in information) as others featured on the site.
After your article is published, make sure to alert the proper channels so it can get the necessary announcements!

## New major page
If you'd like to make a new major page, similar to the currently used home page or the languages page, make sure to consult with the team beforehand.
There potentially may be an overhaul of the site layout if that's the case.

## Issues and bugfixing
Just use the default GitHub issues page to report bugs. Bugfixes should be made in a separate branch before committing to the master branch in order to ensure compatability.
