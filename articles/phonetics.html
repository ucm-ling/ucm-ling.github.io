                    <p><em>Phonetics</em>&nbsp;is the study and classification of speech sounds, and linguists who study phonetics are called <em>phoneticians</em>. The word <em>phonetics</em>&nbsp;is derived from the ancient Greek word <em>phōnē</em>, which
                        means 'sounds' or 'to speak'.</p>
                    <p>Individual speech sounds, like [b] or [k] are called <strong>phones</strong>— not to be confused with actual phones, like the one in your pocket! There’s a finite amount of them, since we use our vocal tract to make noise and it’s
                        not capable of producing an infinite number of noises.<br></p>

                            <p>Since the sixteenth century, we have made efforts to use a universal system for writing down sounds. Today, we use the&nbsp;<strong>International Phonetic Alphabet</strong>, which is commonly abbreviated to&nbsp;<strong>IPA</strong>.
                                You can find the alphabet&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/English">here</a>.<br></p>
                            <p>Normally, the transcription is indicated by brackets: the “<strong>b</strong>” sound in “<strong>b</strong>uy” is denoted by [b] The IPA represents speech in&nbsp;<strong>segments</strong>, like the individual [b] phone in
                                the previous example.<br></p>

                    <h2>Making Noise</h2>
                    <p>Sound is basically just airwaves vibrating really fast in your ear. So, in order for us to make speech sounds, we have to vibrate air really fast. As you already know, we have a special place on our body just for this: the&nbsp;<strong>larynx</strong>,
                        located at your Adam’s apple. It houses the&nbsp;<strong>vocal folds</strong>&nbsp;(sometimes referred to as cords) which you use to manipulate the air your lungs provide into speech sounds, and it’s also made out of cartilage.<br></p>
                    <p>As air flows outta the lungs and up the&nbsp;<strong>trachea</strong>&nbsp;(sometimes called windpipe), and into your larynx. As it goes through the vocal cords, which is also called the&nbsp;<strong>glottis</strong>, different&nbsp;<em>glottal states</em>&nbsp;are
                        achieved.<br></p>
                    <h3>Glottal States</h3>
                    <p>The two glottal states are:&nbsp;<strong>voiceless</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>voiced</strong>.<br></p>
                    <p>When the vocal folds are pulled apart and air passes directly through without a lot of interference, it produces&nbsp;<strong>voiceless</strong>&nbsp;sound.<br></p>
                    <p>Try this: feel your vocal cords as you say the first sound in the word “shy.” Now try it with “bird.”&nbsp;<br></p>
                    <p>Notice how the [b] in “bird” causes your vocal cords to vibrate? That’s voiced, while the [ʃ] sound in “shy” is voiceless since there is little to no interference caused by (non-present) vocal cord vibrations.<br></p>
                    <h3>Classifying Sound<br></h3>
                    <p>The most basic division of sounds is between the&nbsp;<strong>vowels</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>consonants</strong>, but there are also the&nbsp;<strong>glides</strong>&nbsp;who share properties of both.<br></p>
                    <p>Consonants can be either voiced or voiceless but are made with either a complete closure or a narrowing of the vocal tract. You create consonants by blocking or restricting the airflow. Vowels, which are usually voiced, are made without
                        much obstruction in the vocal tract.<br></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Note: for all vowels, the tip of your tongue stays down by your lower front teeth.</em><br></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Vowels also happen to be more&nbsp;<strong>sonorous</strong>&nbsp;than consonants, and so we perceive them as louder and longer lasting.<br></p>
                    <p><strong>Syllables</strong>&nbsp;are peaks of sonority— they are surrounded by less sonorous segments. When you count syllables, you are in effect counting vowels, so it can be said that they form the nucleus of a syllable.<br></p>

                <p>Glides can be thought of as rapidly articulated vowels that move quickly to another articulation, like in&nbsp;<strong>y</strong>et and&nbsp;<strong>w</strong>et, or like bo<strong>y</strong>&nbsp;and no<strong>w</strong>. These guys never
                    form the nucleus of a syllable, since they show properties of both consonants and vowels.<br></p>

                        <h3>Manners of articulation</h3>
                        <p>We generally classify our sounds by their manners of articulation— basically how we actually use those articulators. In general, most sounds are egressive, meaning we push air out of lungs to make them, but there are a few examples
                            of ingressive sounds, where we take air into the lungs.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>There are <strong>glottal stops</strong>, where we abruptly bring our vocal folds together and hold them tightly together, as in when you say <em>uh oh!</em>&nbsp;There are <strong>voiced sounds</strong>, where we vibrate our vocal
                            folds, like the z in <em>zoo</em>. And then there are <strong>voiceless sounds</strong>, where we don't vibrate our vocal folds, as in the s in <em>Sam</em>.&nbsp;<br></p>
                        <p>But linguists are very finnicky with classifications. So, there's tons of manners of articulations. Here's a few that we definetly use in English.&nbsp;</p>

                        <h3>Suprasegmentals</h3>
                        <p>Phones have&nbsp;<strong>suprasegmental</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>prosodic properties</strong>, like&nbsp;<strong>pitch</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>loudness</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>length</strong>.<br></p>
                        <p>Pitch allows us to place it on a scale from high to low, and is especially noticeable in sonorous sounds like vowels, glides, liquids, and nasals.<br></p>
                        <p>The control of pitch results in&nbsp;<strong>tone</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>intonation</strong>.<br></p>
                        <p>A language is said to have tone when&nbsp;<strong>differences in word meaning are signaled by differences in pitch</strong>.<br></p>
                        <p>When one says “A&nbsp;<em>car?</em>” with a raising pitch, the word “car” refers to the same thing as when it’s pronounced without that raised pitch; this is&nbsp;<strong>intonation</strong>. In contrast, a speaker of Mandarin
                            can say entirely different words by changing the pitch; this is&nbsp;<strong>tone</strong>. For instance: [mà] with a falling pitch means something entirely different than [má] with a rising pitch.<br></p>
                        <p>The amount and classification of tone varies from language to language.<br></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>But.. intonation signals meaning too, right?</em><br>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Yes! It does, but it does not change the meaning of a word, rather just signals something&nbsp;<em>different</em>.<br></li>
                                    <li>For instance, if I raise my pitch when saying a phrase, it signals that the phrase might be incomplete— teachers and professors do this all the time when they want students to finish their sentences.<br></li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Also, it’s worth noting that some languages make use of both intonation and tone&nbsp;<em>at the same time</em>.<br></p>
                        <p>Sometimes, vowels are perceived as more prominent than others, like how in “banana” the second syllable is more prominent than the other two.&nbsp;<strong>Stress</strong>&nbsp;covers the combined effects of pitch, loudness and
                            length, which gives us this perceived prominence.<br></p>

                <h2>Acoustic phonetics</h2>
                <p></p>
                <p>As you can tell from the name, in acoustic phonetics we study the actual physical, acoustic properties of speech sounds. It serves to fundamentally abstract linguistics all the way down to physics. Sometimes, phoneticians use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram">spectrograms</a>                    of speech to look more deeply into their nature. Obviously, this special subset of phonetics gets very mathy very quickly.</p>
                <p>At the most basic level, there are four parts to a sound wave.</p>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col">
                        <p>The <strong>wavelength</strong>&nbsp;is the distance between a peaks of waves. It's the horizontal length of one cycle of the wave.</p>
                        <p>The <strong>period</strong>&nbsp;is the time it take sto complete one cycle.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The <strong>frequency</strong>&nbsp;is the number of cycles that pass a set point in a second, usually measured in Hertz (Hz). It's connected to pitch, with higher frequency meaning higher pitch and lower frequency meaning lower
                            pitch.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The <strong>amplitude</strong>&nbsp;is represented by the height of the waves. Louder sounds have louder amplitudes, and vice versa. It's usally measured in decibels (dB), and the softest sound we can hear is the zero point. We
                            normally speak at 60 dB.&nbsp;</p>

                        <h2>Speech perception</h2>
                        <p>Speech perception deserves an article of it's own, as it's study is deep and storied. It's the process by which sounds are heard, interpreted and understood and plays closely with phonetics and phonology, as well as cognitive science
                            as a whole. It has applications in computer recognition of speech, like in Siri or even Google Translate.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>The sound of speech contains acoustic cues that scientists use to differentiate speech sounds belonging to different phonetic categories. One example would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_onset_time">voice onset time</a>,
                            which can signal the difference between voiced and voiceless stops like "b" and "p."&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>This process is at an intersection of many discplines and is wonderful for demonstrating the interdisciplinary nature of linguistics. In order to understand speech perception, one must draw from cognitive science, linguistics,
                            psychology, and occasionally even computer science.</p>
