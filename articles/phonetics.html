                    <p><em>Phonetics</em>&nbsp;is the study and classification of speech sounds, and linguists who study phonetics are called <em>phoneticians</em>. The word <em>phonetics</em>&nbsp;is derived from the ancient Greek word <em>phōnē</em>, which
                        means 'sounds' or 'to speak'.</p>
                    <p>Individual speech sounds, like [b] or [k] are called <em>phones</em>— not to be confused with actual phones, like the one in your pocket!</p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col">
                            <p>So, how do phoneticians actually study speech sounds? They mainly look at three things:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Speech production</strong>: <em>Articulatory phonetics</em>&nbsp;looks at how you make speech sounds using your mouth, tongue, lips, and throat.<br>In other words: how do you make any sounds at all?</li>
                                <li><strong>Sound waves</strong>: <em>Acoustic phonetics</em>&nbsp;looks at the acoustic structure of the sound waves.<br>In other words: what even is speech on a physical level?</li>
                                <li><strong>Speech perception</strong>: <em>Perceptual acoustics</em>&nbsp;looks at what you&nbsp;do to speech sounds when they reach your ears.&nbsp;<br>In other words: how are you processing those sounds?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Obviously, it's not as easy as it sounds to study these things.</p>

                                    <h4 class="text-warning card-title">Why study phonetics?</h4>

                                    <p class="text-light card-text">Phonetics is used to help develop technology like Siri or Google Assistant, not only in their capacity to speak but also in their ability to hear! These technologies are relied upon by many people from people who simply
                                        have their hands full to people with severe vision disabilities, like blindness.&nbsp;</p>

                <div class="col">
                    <p>Firstly, speech sounds come in a garbled mess. Even individual phonemes come packed along with noise and tons of other overlapping layers of frequencies and information. On top of that, scientists have to use some pretty involved methods
                        to separate what is speech from what is not in an audio recording. Some of this makes use of some very cool mathematics, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">fourier transforms</a>.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Not only this, but speech is as fast as the speed of sound— literally and figuratively. Speech sounds only last a fraction of a second, and then they're gone. The structures that produce these sounds, like your tongue and your teeth,
                        usually aren't visible either, so the only way to figure out what you're saying by vision would be to lipread!</p>
                    <p>So, phoneticians really have their work cut out for them. What have they discovered so far?</p>
                    <h2>Articulatory Phonetics</h2>
                    <p>Sound, and therefore speech, is produced by simply forcing out of your lungs. However, in order to make this useful, we use our speech organs to shape the air into a sound that is distinct and unique from others. Sounds of all languages
                        fall under two categories: consonant and vowel.&nbsp;</p>
                    <h3>Places of articulation</h3>
                    <p>In order to make a consonant, you need to provide some form of restriction to air when you speak. The areas where we shape the air are called places of articulation. Consonants are also classified by where the airflow has been restricted
                        in order to create them.</p>
                    <p>Vowels, on the other hand, are produced by the passage of air through the larynx and vocal tract and are <strong>voiced</strong>, meaning that the vocal folds are vibrating when you create them.&nbsp;</p>

                            <p>We generally classify our sounds by their manners of articulation— basically how we actually use those articulators. In general, most sounds are egressive, meaning we push air out of lungs to make them, but there are a few
                                examples of ingressive sounds, where we take air into the lungs.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>There are <strong>glottal stops</strong>, where we abruptly bring our vocal folds together and hold them tightly together, as in when you say <em>uh oh!</em>&nbsp;There are <strong>voiced sounds</strong>, where we vibrate our
                                vocal folds, like the z in <em>zoo</em>. And then there are <strong>voiceless sounds</strong>, where we don't vibrate our vocal folds, as in the s in <em>Sam</em>.&nbsp;<br></p>
                            <p>But linguists are very finnicky with classifications. So, there's tons of manners of articulations. Here's a few that we definetly use in English.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p></p>
                    <p>As you can tell from the name, in acoustic phonetics we study the actual physical, acoustic properties of speech sounds. It serves to fundamentally abstract linguistics all the way down to physics. Sometimes, phoneticians use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram">spectrograms</a>                        of speech to look more deeply into their nature. Obviously, this special subset of phonetics gets very mathy very quickly.</p>
                    <p>At the most basic level, there are four parts to a sound wave.</p>
                    <div class="row">

                            <p>The <strong>wavelength</strong>&nbsp;is the distance between a peaks of waves. It's the horizontal length of one cycle of the wave.</p>
                            <p>The <strong>period</strong>&nbsp;is the time it take sto complete one cycle.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>The <strong>frequency</strong>&nbsp;is the number of cycles that pass a set point in a second, usually measured in Hertz (Hz). It's connected to pitch, with higher frequency meaning higher pitch and lower frequency meaning
                                lower pitch.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>The <strong>amplitude</strong>&nbsp;is represented by the height of the waves. Louder sounds have louder amplitudes, and vice versa. It's usally measured in decibels (dB), and the softest sound we can hear is the zero point.
                                We normally speak at 60 dB.&nbsp;</p>

                            <h2>Speech perception</h2>
                            <p>Speech perception deserves an article of it's own, as it's study is deep and storied. It's the process by which sounds are heard, interpreted and understood and plays closely with phonetics and phonology, as well as cognitive
                                science as a whole. It has applications in computer recognition of speech, like in Siri or even Google Translate.&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>The sound of speech contains acoustic cues that scientists use to differentiate speech sounds belonging to different phonetic categories. One example would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_onset_time">voice onset time</a>,
                                which can signal the difference between voiced and voiceless stops like "b" and "p."&nbsp;</p>
                            <p>This process is at an intersection of many discplines and is wonderful for demonstrating the interdisciplinary nature of linguistics. In order to understand speech perception, one must draw from cognitive science, linguistics,
                                psychology, and occasionally even computer science.</p>
