                    <h1><strong>AFRICAN AMERICAN VERNACULAR ENGLISH IS NOT STANDARD ENGLISH WITH MISTAKES</strong><br></h1><small>written by&nbsp;<em>Geoffrey K. Pullum, 1999</em><br></small>
                    <p>It is unusual for a policy announcement at a city school-board meeting to trigger a worldwide media frenzy, but one California school-board meeting in December 1996 did exactly that. Within days of the announcement, school-board members
                        could not leave their homes without being besieged by journalists. They were vilified, ridiculed, and attacked in newspapers and magazines around the entire world. What had happened?</p>
                    <p>The board had issued a statement to the effect that it was changing its educational policies with regard to one aspect of the local linguistic situation. They would pay more serious attention to the language spoken at home by most
                        of the district’s school students. Its status would be recognized, teachers would be trained to look at it objectively and appreciate its merits, and it would be used in the classroom as appropriate. This much was reported by the
                        <em>New York Times</em> quite accurately and fairly. Yet opinion writers proceed to fall upon the topic like starving dogs attacking a bone. They ridiculed, they sneered, they frothed, they flamed, they raged, they lived off the
                        story for weeks. The talk-radio switchboards lit up, and the intemperate opinions flared. What was going on?<br></p>
                    <p>The answer lies in the fact that the language being recognized by the school board was not Spanish or Polish or Russian or any such relatively uncontroversial language. The city was Oakland, a poor city on the east side of San Francisco
                        Bay where half the population is African American, and the language was one that linguists usually call African American Vernacular English (AAVE).</p>
                    <p>What makes AAVE so dramatically different as a political issue from, say, Spanish (also spoken in Oakland, by up to a quarter of the population) is its close relation to another language of much higher prestige. Most speakers of Standard
                        English think that AAVE is just a badly spoken version of their language, marred by a lot of ignorant mistakes in grammar and pronunciation, or worse than that, an unimportant and mostly abusive repertoire of street slang used
                        by an ignorant urban underclass. An editorial in the <em>New York Times</em> a few days after the first news report said that the Oakland school board had “declared that black slang is a distinct language.”</p>
                    <p>Let me begin by getting that myth out of the way. The <em>Times</em>’s statement about slang was completely untrue, and the writers should be ashamed of themselves. So should all the newspapers and magazines that followed them. The
                        governing board of the Oakland Unified School District never mentioned slang and never intended to imply anything approving about it.</p>
                    <p>We call an expression slang when it represents a vivid, colloquial word or phrase associated with some subculture not yet incorporated as part of the mainstream language. No subculture’s slang could constitute a separate language.
                        The mistake is like confusing a sprinkle of hot sauce with a dinner. Slang is by definition parasitic on some larger and more encompassing host language. It has no grammar of its own; it is a small array of words and phrases used
                        under the aegis of some ordinary language and in accordance with its grammar. The majority of slang words and phrases are in the language already and are merely assigned new slang meanings by some subpopulation.&nbsp;<br></p>
                    <p>The Oakland school board was not endorsing the nonsensical idea that black slang should be recognized as a new language. The statement it released may have been wordy, diffuse, and filled with bad bureaucratese and pompous-sounding
                        references to “African Language Systems,” but the intent was clear enough: the board wanted to acknowledge that AAVE was distinct in certain respects from Standard English, and it proposed to be responsive to the educational implications.<br></p>
                    <p>Buried among the jargon of the announcements was a mention of a name for AAVE, suggested by a Black scholar in 1975 but never adopted by linguists: Ebonics. That word, concocted from <em>ebony</em> (a color term for the name of a dark-colored
                        wood) and <em>phonics</em> (the name of a method for teaching reading), was destined to attach to the board as if chiseled into a block of granite and hung round their necks. They would never hear the end of it.<br></p>
                    <p>One problem with the name was that it lent itself irresistibly to stupid puns and jokes. The <em>Economist</em> picked it up and printed a brief story headed “The Ebonics virus,” a tasteless reference to the then-recent outbreak of
                        the horrible Ebola fever in Zaire (the subliminal link: nasty things out of Africa). People rapidly invented other -<em>onics</em> words to mock the idea of letting African Americans have their own claim to a language. Would Jewish
                        people propose that their way of speaking English should be designated Hebonics? Could stupid people complain that they were victims of their native language, Moronics? Cartoonists seemed to find such possibilities endlessly amusing,
                        and the jokes kept coming for more than a year.<br></p>
                    <p>But I will not be primarily concerned here with analysis of the politics and the rhetoric that the “Ebonics” story provoked. I will be concerned with AAVE itself, the everyday speech of millions of people in largely segregated African
                        American districts. The majority of English speakers think that AAVE is just English with two added factors: some special slang terms and a lot of grammatical mistakes. They are simply wrong about this.<br></p>
                    <h2>LANGUAGE, DIALECTS, AND RULES<br></h2>
                    <p>Let me begin by pointing out that there is obviously a difference between being an incorrect utterance of one language and being a correct utterance in another (perhaps only slightly different). This is obvious when the two languages
                        are thoroughly different, like English and French. When a French speaker refers to the capital of the United Kingdom as Londres, it isn’t a mistake; that’s the correct French name for London. But the same is true when we are talking
                        about two very closely related languages. There is a strong temptation, especially when one of the two has higher prestige, to take one to be the correct way to speak and the other to be incorrect. But it is not necessarily so.<br></p>
                    <p>I will consider a fairly subtle example involving a grammatical difference between two varieties of Standard English. Some speakers, but not all, use the word <em>whom</em> instead of <em>who</em> in some contexts. Those who do use
                        <em>whom</em> always use it after a preposition (“a man in <em>whom</em> I have complete confidence”) and may use it after a verb (“And after that you visited <em>whom</em>?”), and they may use it at the beginning of a sentence
                        (though, “<em>Whom</em> did you visit?” sounds rather stiff, and many would avoid it). But most people, even expert writers of English, will confess to scratching their heads a little about the following two cases:&nbsp;<br></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>We are talking about a man who everyone seems to think will one day be king.</li>
                        <li>We are talking about a man whom everyone seems to think one day will be king.&nbsp;</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Which version is right? Dimly we may remember something from the grammar books about using <em>who</em> for subjects and <em>whom</em> for nonsubjects. Can’t we just apply that? No, we can’t. The rule “use <em>who</em> for subjects
                        and <em>whom</em> for nonsubjects” is insufficiently explicit. These examples involve a relative clause that begins after the word <em>man</em>. The next word (<em>who </em>or <em>whom</em>) introduces the relative clause (<em>everyone seems to think </em>__
                        <em>will one day be king</em>). There are two things that “subject” might mean here: “subject of its clause,” that is, subject of the clause that it logically belongs to, or “subject of the relative clause.” The word <em>who</em>                        is logically the subject in a clause that has <em>will one day be king</em> as its predicate; if that allows it to count as a subject, then version (1) is correct. But the subject of the whole relative clause is not <em>who</em>                        but rather <em>everyone</em>. The word <em>who </em>is not the logical subject of that, but just a piece of it. If that’s what we mean by being a subject, then we should pick sentence (2).<br></p>
                    <p>Where do we turn to decide this point? We look in good manuals of English usage. And we immediately find something very interesting: there are clear examples of both types in literary works by the best authors. The <em>who</em> group—those
                        whose writing suggests that they would plump for (1)—includes Arnold Bennett, Charles Dickens, Henry Fielding, and William Safire (the <em>New York Times’</em>s language pundit). Good company. But the <em>whom</em> group, whose
                        usage shows they would select (2), includes early writers like William Caxton and Izaak Walton, famous novelists like Charles Kingsley and Rudyard Kipling, romantic poets like John Keats and Percy Bysshe Shelley, and at least some
                        <em>New York Times</em> and <em>Publishers Weekly</em> writers, together with Charles Darwin and William Shakespeare. That, too, is a dream team.</p>
                    <p>What is going on? The answer is that there are two different rules involved. Some writers follow one, while others follow the other. The members of the <em>who</em> group tacitly assume that <em>who</em> has to be the subject of its
                        clause; the members of the <em>whom</em> group tacitly assume that <em>who</em> has to be the subject of the relative clause.</p>
                    <p>What we have discovered is a division between two <em>syntactic dialects</em>—two sectors of the speech community that have very slightly different grammars. By assuming that speakers fall into these two dialect groups, you can explain
                        both the consistencies of practice and the disagreements that occur. The disagreements do not become evident very often: only on the rare occasions when <em>who</em> occurs as the understood subject of a clause contained in a relative
                        clause without being the subject of the relative clause as a whole.<br></p>
                    <p>It is crucially important to notice that people do not just flounder, as if they did not know <em>who</em> from <em>whom</em> any more. To describe either the <em>who</em> group or the <em>whom</em> group as people who are ignorant
                        of the grammar of the language in which they are writing would be absurd. More specifically, it would predict quite falsely that you will find them blundering into sentences like the follow (the asterisk prefix means that the string
                        is not a sentence):<br></p>
                    <ol start="3">
                        <li>
                            <ol type="a">
                                <li>*Whom wants to come and play tennis?&nbsp;</li>
                                <li>*I’m the one whom loves you.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <ol type="a">
                                <li>*He is a man for who I have the highest regard.</li>
                                <li>*To who do you refer?</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Nobody writes things like this. So it is not true that “anything goes” regarding the use of <em>who</em> and <em>whom</em>. There are rules. But it is also not true that there is a single correct rule governing everything about <em>who</em>                        and <em>whom</em> and some people have failed to learn it. That does not predict the facts correctly. There is a better theory, and it is set out informally in (5):<br></p>
                    <ol start="5">
                        <li>
                            <ol type="a">
                                <li>All English speakers use <em>who</em> when it is in subject position in a simple clause.</li>
                                <li>Those speakers who use <em>whom</em> can always use it as the direct object of a transitive verb and as the object of a preposition.</li>
                                <li>For <em>who</em> at the beginning of a relative clause there are two different rules, defining two bona fide syntactic dialects of the English language.<br>They are the following:
                                    <ol type="i">
                                        <li>Use <em>whom</em> when it is the subject of the clause in which it logically belongs.</li>
                                        <li>Use <em>who</em> when it is the subject of the relative clause.&nbsp;</li>
                                    </ol>
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Rules (i) and (ii) both agree that you should use <em>who</em> in “anyone who wants to leave” because there it is both the subject of its own clause and the subject of the relative clause (which are one and the same). But on other
                        sentences the two rules decide things differently. The <em>who</em> group (Dickens, Safire, and company) assume (i) and thus regard example (1) as correct; the <em>whom</em> group (Shakespeare, Darwin and company) assume rule (ii)
                        and thus favor example (2). What this shows is that even within Standard English there is a difference between making mistakes and speaking a different variety correctly—a difference between marching out of time and marching to
                        the beat of a different drum.<br></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;With these preliminaries out of the way, I now turn to AAVE, which turns out to be the most interestingly divergent dialect of modern English.<br></p>
                    <h2>THE AFRICAN AMERICAN VERNACULAR DIALECT OF ENGLISH<br></h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;The Oakland school board suggested that AAVE had its own rules and structure. Opinionmongers displayed anger and contempt at this. They mocked, lampooned, and attacked the very idea. But a large amount of the ink they splattered
                        was wasted on a pointless side issue: whether AAVE was really “a separate language” from English or whether it was “just a dialect.” The Oakland school board made the mistake of insisting explicitly that it was a separate language.
                        That is another red herring (like the slang issue).&nbsp;<br></p>
                    <p>Dialects and languages are in fact the same kinds of things. “Dialect” does not mean a marginal, archaic, rustic, or degraded mode of speech. Linguists never say things like “That is just a dialect, not a language.” Rather, they refer
                        to one language as <em>a dialect of </em>another. The claim that Tosk is a dialect of Albanian is a classificatory claim, like saying that the white-tailed deer is a kind of deer. It is not some kind of put-down of Tosk speakers.<br></p>
                    <p>Of course, in practice, political considerations do tend to enter decisions about when one language should be called a dialect of another. Albania is currently one country, and Tosk and Gheg are treated as dialects of one Albanian
                        language (even though it is hard to understand one if you only know the other); but in the wrecked ex-country of Yugoslavia, the language people used to call Serbo-Croat began during the 1990s to be deliberately split up into three
                        separate languages, Serbian, Croatian, and Bosnian, because the speakers had fallen out politically. No one would have said before that there were three languages here, even though the Croatian Yugoslavs talked a bit differently
                        from the Serbian and Bosnian Yugoslavs. There was assumed to be one Serbo-Croat language (there is a book called <em>Teach Yourself Serbo-Croat</em>). This single language would have been described as having several different dialects—regional
                        or ethnic variants of the same basic linguistic system. But once Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia separated, the differences among the three trivially differing[sic] languages had to be emphasized and accentuated. The Serbs, stressing
                        their Eastern Orthodox religious roots, revived Old Church Slavonic words and mandated use of the Cyrillic (Russian) alphabet; the Croats stressed their Catholic roots, borrowed more words from Latin, and stuck with the Roman alphabet;
                        and the Bosnian Muslims borrowed words from Turkish to emphasize their connections with the Islamic world. Linguistic boundary lines began to emerge to reinforce the ethnic boundary lines.<br></p>
                    <p>Reference works on the languages of the world take different views of how many linguistics boundaries to recognize. Reasonable scholars can differ on how coarse grained or fine grained a classification is appropriate (and on how much
                        politics should be taken into account). So it is important that in classifying AAVE there is no dispute. For example, I keep near my desk two reference books on the languages of the world; Grimes’s <em>Ethnologue</em> and the Voegelins’
                        <em>Classification and Index of the World’s Languages</em>. The <em>Ethnologue</em> recognizes more than fifteen separate romance languages in Italy, while <em>Classification and Index</em> recognizes just three (Italian, Friulian,
                        and Ladin). But both list AAVE as a dialect of English.&nbsp;<br></p>
                    <p>This is undoubtedly the right classification. Virtually all the words used in AAVE can be clearly identified in Standard English too, and most of AAVE grammar is the same as that of Standard English. The bits that are not are mostly
                        paralleled in certain other dialects of English that are never mistaken for other languages. As linguist John McWhorter has pointed out, there certainly are examples, in some parts of the world, of African languages that have kept
                        their African syntax and simply replaced the words of the dictionary by English words (they are known as creole languages), and AAVE just is not like that.<br></p>
                    <p>This is not an insulting or demeaning thing to say about AAVE. It merely places it in a linguistic classification that unites the language of Shakespeare and the language of the Oakland ghetto very closely compared to languages in
                        other families or in other parts of the Germanic family. It is no more insulting to call AAVE a variety (or dialect) of English than it is to say that African Americans are U.S. citizens.<br></p>
                    <p>It was not merely a matter of an incorrect classificatory claim when the Oakland school board made its wordy statements about how the district’s black students used “African Language Systems” that did not constitute a dialect of English.
                        It was also a major tactical error. It deflected virtually all the discussion into negative channels; journalists vied with each other to insist that AAVE should not be recognized as a language. What got lost was a much more sensible
                        and reasonable point: AAVE as a dialect of English still deserves respect and acceptance. It has a degree of regularity and stability attributable to a set of rules of grammar and pronunciation, as with any language. It differs
                        strikingly from Standard English, but there is no more reason for calling it bad Standard English than there is for dismissing Minnesota English as bad Virginia speech, or the reverse. Journalists did not get this; nearly everything
                        they wrote about the purported errors that characterize AAVE was factually incorrect. It is worth devoting a little time to close analysis of some examples that demonstrate this.<br></p>
